# Getting Started

## Expectation
Getting started at Dwarves Foundation can be overwhelming. Different roles have different expectation. Get to know [who does what](who-does-what.md)  to warm up. There are a lot of little details, a number of big tasks, you’re learning a new job and new coworkers, and you’re likely doing all these things while working remotely. 

Your Dwarves buddy, your Ops buddy, and your manager are all here to help.  There is no set time period for most training periods, but most people are up to speed in about 2 months.

## The first probation period
During the first probation period, your primary goals are Ready for the job and Get along with your peers.

### Be ready for the job
Your interview is a screening round for us. Every assumption we made will be pulled out for judgment.
- The first 2 weeks could be easy if everything goes well. Your performance will tell.
- The following 6 weeks might be harsh, as we love to have like-minded people around.
- We’ll have a review check every 2 weeks to evaluate your progress and how you get along. Please feel free to raise up any question towards the work and the team to take the next suitable action.

### Get along with your peers
- Learn & adapt to how the team behaves through the Culture section.
- It’s essential to check out those books: Remote & Rework
- We work remotely. It could be hard to know the others. Be open on the team Campfire so people can know you better.
- We love to discuss the technology, software & design practices, also internet funny kinds of stuff.
- Small talks are okay but don’t do it always.
- Respect is earned, not given. The Dwarves admire the manager of one and who are strong in their fields.

Usually, when you start a new job in an office, it’s clear who does what. In a remote company, it’s a little less clear. Even when you know [who does what](who-does-what.md), it’s still nice to have a work buddy to ping when you don’t know where to turn. So we set up a [Fortress system](https://fort.dwarves.foundation).
