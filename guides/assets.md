# Asset Request

Company assets equips us on getting the job done. We are glad to know if you can spend your spare time gnawing our library or using our devices, just amke sure it follows these protocols

### 1. Borrowing
We use Basecamp for team communication. Woodland contains things all the team should know. In the **Lending Asset** list, create a ticket on this format:

> Your Name | Type - Name/Id of the asset | Borrowing date | Returning date 
and a picture of the asset for proof. 

e.g.: If Huy wants to spend a week with the book Start With Why, he shall create a ticket like this:

> Huy Nguyen | Book - Start With Why | 19/04/2021 | 26/04/2021

and assign Duy/Van to handle the request. 

We will get back to you by the time of returning date. In the event of extending the borrowing time, please help to adjust the timeline and drop an update to the comment section of that ticket. 

### 2. Returning
The Dwarves are required to report any problems experienced with the item during the borrowing period. But most of all, we look forward to having you enjoy using it and have the item returned in full conditions. 

### 3. Request
In case your will to learn is far beyond our current resource, the Dwarves have all right to ask for a purchase of specialized materials. As long as it fits our budget or does not get us bankrupted, we've got you covered. 

**3.1. Requesting**
The requesting process is not much different from the borrowing one, with a reasonable purpose. If the item bypasses our budget, we would prefer to substitute it with an alternative option.

and assign our HR for approval. 

**3.2. Processing**
HR will handle this part from now on. Once we got the approval, HR will have the item ordered and get you notified when it is ready to use.

By this stage, HR will also mark done on the ticket to wrap up the process.
